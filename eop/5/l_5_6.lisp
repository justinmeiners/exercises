; LEMMA
; In an ordered additive monoid viewed as a semi-module over the natural numbers

; a > 0 and n > 0 => na > 0

; PROOF
; Suppose n = 1, then na = a > 0
; for a natural number n >= 1 assume that a + a + ... + a = (n- 1)a > 0.
; then (a + a + .. + a) + a = na + a
; AND
; na + a >= a + a > a > 0
; 
; So (n + 1)a > 0
; Therefore it holds for all natural numbers by induction.
