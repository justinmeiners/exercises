# [Crackpot index](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html)

> 20 points for emailing me and complaining about the crackpot index. (E.g., saying that it "suppresses original thinkers" or saying that I misspelled "Einstein" in item 8.)

Discrediting critiques in the definition? This is ridiculous. "everyone who disagree's me with me is stupid, we know because they disagree."

> 10 points for each statement along the lines of "I'm not good at math, but my theory is conceptually right, so all I need is for someone to express it in terms of equations"

> 10 points for arguing that a current well-established theory is "only a theory", as if this were somehow a point against it

> 50 points for claiming you have a revolutionary theory but giving no concrete testable predictions.

> 40 points for comparing yourself to Galileo, suggesting that a modern-day Inquisition is hard at work on your case, and so on.

> A simple method for rating potentially revolutionary contributions to physics

> 20 points for every use of science fiction works or myths as if they were fact.

> 10 points for mailing your theory to someone you don't know personally and asking them not to tell anyone else about it, for fear that your ideas will be stolen.

> 30 points for suggesting that Einstein, in his later years, was groping his way towards the ideas you now advocate.

> 30 points for suggesting that a famous figure secretly disbelieved in a theory which he or she publicly supported. (E.g., that Feynman was a closet opponent of special relativity, as deduced by reading between the lines in his freshman physics textbooks.)

> 10 points for claiming that your work is on the cutting edge of a "paradigm shift"

I believe that paradigm shifts are real, this has unfortunately become a buzzword for "idea".

> 10 points for pointing out that you have gone to school, as if this were evidence of sanity.

> 40 points for comparing those who argue against your ideas to Nazis, stormtroopers, or brownshirts.

Didn't he kind of do that on #20?

> 5 points for using a thought experiment that contradicts the results of a widely accepted real experiment.

> 10 points for arguing that while a current well-established theory predicts phenomena correctly, it doesn't explain "why" they occur, or fails to provide a "mechanism"

This is interesting. Is physics supposed to be a entirely description? In other words, are theories that are mechanistic inherently better than teological ones?
