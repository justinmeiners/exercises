**Theorem:** Suppose there is a sequence of positive real numbers such that $a_{1}a_{2}... a_{n}=1$ then 

$$(1+a_{1})(1+a_{2})...(1+a_{n})\geq2^{n}$$

**Proof:** Let $n=1$ then clearly $a_{1}=1$ and $(1+1)\geq2$

Assume the claim is true for all sequences of length $k<n$. Then from a sequence $a_{1}a_{2}..a_{n}$, let $c=a_{i}a_{j}$ where $a_{i}\geq1$ and $a_{j}\leq1$. We know we can pick these because otherwise the product must be less or than greater one.

Then $c(a_{1}a_{2}...a_{n})= 1$ where $i\neq j$ and $i\neq k$ and by the induction hypothesis:

$$(c+1)(a_{1}+1)(a_{2}+1)...(a_{n}+1)\geq 2^{n-1}$$

And  
$$(1+a_{i})(1+a_{j})=a_{i}a_{j}+a_{i}+a_{j}+1$$

We want to show this product is greater than $2(c+1)$.

$$(1-a_{j})\geq (1-a_{j})$$

$$a_{i}(1-a_{j})\geq (1-a_{j})$$ since $a_{i}\geq 1$.

$$a_{i}-a_{i}a_{j}\geq (1-a_{j})$$

$$a_{i} + a_{j} \geq a_{i}a_{j} + 1$$

$$a_{i} + a_{j} + (a_{i}a_{j} + 1) \geq a_{i}a_{j} + 1 + (a_{i}a_{j} + 1)$$

$$(1+a_{i})(1+a_{j}) \geq 2(a_{i}a_{j} + 1) = 2(c+1)$$

Finally:

$$(1+a_{i})(1+a_{j})(a_{1}+1)...(a_{n}+1)\geq 2(c+1)\frac{2^{n-1}}{c+1}=2^{n}$$
